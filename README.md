##Time course of health complaints attribution to RF-EMF exposure##

Some individuals attribute health complaints to radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure. This condition, known as idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to RF-EMFs (IEI-RF) or electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), can be disabling for those who are affected. In this study we assessed factors related to developing, maintaining, or discarding IEI-RF over the course of 10 years, and predictors of developing EHS at follow-up using a targeted question without the condition of reporting health complaints attributed to RF-EMF exposure.

We fitted multi-state Markov models to represent how individuals in our cohort transitioned between two states defined by the presence (“yes”) or absence (“no”) of IEI-RF, and logistic regression models to assess predictors of EHS at follow-up.
